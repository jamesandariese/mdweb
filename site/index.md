## Welcome to `mdweb`

Good work!  It's running.

If you're using this with docker, you probably want to host your own site.
This is very easy to do.

If you're using Docker:

    docker run -d -P -v path/to/site:/site jamesandariese/mdweb

If you're running the executable directly:

    mdweb -site path/to/site

I hope you enjoy using this product.

If you like it and it fills a need, please consider providing
feedback, a jefferson, or whatever.
